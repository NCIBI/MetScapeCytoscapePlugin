0) Background

	This process assumes that you are working in a unix environment: the Mac, cygwin (on Windows), or 
	some other *nix OS. It is assumed that an svn client and Maven are installed. The last version of the
	scripts were run using svn version 1.6.6 and Maven version 3.0.3. The scripts are written for bash.

	MetScape depends on a number of other NCIBI projects, these are listed in various places in the
	scripts that follow. For completeness, aside from metscape2-plugin, itself they are: 
	metab-ws-client, metab-ws-common, metab-ws-server, ncibi-commons, ncibi-db, ncibi-webbackend,
	ws-client, ws-common, ws-ncibi, ws-ncibi-client, ws-ncibi-common, ws-ncibi-executor, ws-server-common

	These notes assume that all of these projects have been updated to trunk, and that the trunk,
	configuration of the MetScape plugin is using those trunk versions of the associated projects.
	
	These notes rely on a number of scripts for articulation of details. See the folder 'scripts' for
	those scripts.
	
	Running the scripts for install depends on having set up the build and pdeploy commands. 
	Separate documentation is supplied for that.
	
1) Create branches for all the associated projects.
	See the script 'generateAllBranchCommands.sh' in the 'scripts' folder.
	Edit this script; generate and run the commands.
	Note: I did not have the script run the commands because the process has proven fragile enough
		that it requires running the commands separately
		
2) Checkout the branches. See the script: checkoutAllBranches.sh.

3) Build and install all the projects creating pbuild modules where needed. See the script: buildBranches.sh.
Noe: the build script also does an update, but if the code changes and you only need to do an update, see the
script: updateAllBranches.sh

4) Deploy the pdeploy modules on the server: for each module copy to the server and run the pdeploy command.
